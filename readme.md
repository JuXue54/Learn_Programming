# Learn Programming

There are codes of several tasks and projects that were created when I was learning programming. From my point of view, it's really nice to record my study and works as soon as possible since it can help me remember What I've learned. I believe I can be a good learner by doing this.
These files includes several works I've made:

+ [**P5_js**](./p5_js/) includes tasks from the course called *Introduction to Computer Programming* provided by University of London in Coursera
+ [**Algorithms_Princeton**](./Algorithms_Princeton/) involves some of the programming assigniments in the course *Algorithms* provided by Princeton University in Coursera
+ [**Algorithms_Stanford**](./Algorithms_Stanford/) have some programming assigniments in the Standford's Algorithms course.

**Note**: Some relative open source codes I used in these tasks and projects are also included in the files.
