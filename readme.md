# Learn Programming

There are codes of several tasks and projects that were created when I was learning programming. From my point of view, it's really nice to record my study and works as soon as possible since it can help me remember What I've learned. I believe I can be a good learner by doing this.
These files includes several works I've made:

+ [P5_js](https://github.com/JuXue54/Learn_Programming/tree/master/p5_js) includes tasks from the course called *Introduction to Computer Programming* provided by University of London in Coursera
+ [Percolation](https://github.com/JuXue54/Learn_Programming/tree/master/Percolation_java) includes a task in the course *Algorithms* provided by Princeton University in Coursera

**Note**: Some relative open source codes that I used in these tasks and projects are also included in the files.
