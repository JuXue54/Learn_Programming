# Learn Programming
There are some codes of some tasks and projects that were written when I was learning programming. From my point of view, it's really nice to record my study and works as soon as possible since it can help me remember What I've learned so that I can be a good learner.
The file includes several works I've made:
+ P5_js includes tasks from the course called *Introduction to Computer Programming* in Coursera
+ Percolation includes a task in the course *Algorithms* in coursera
