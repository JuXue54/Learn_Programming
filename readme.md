# Learn Programming
There are some codes of some tasks and projects that were written when I was learning programming. From my point of view, it's really nice to record my study and works as soon as possible since it can help me remember What I've learned. I believe I can be a good learner by doing this.
The file includes several works I've made:
+ P5_js includes tasks from the course called *Introduction to Computer Programming* in Coursera
+ Percolation includes a task in the course *Algorithms* in Coursera
