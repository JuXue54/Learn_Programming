# kdtree

*KdTree.java* is a data structure that can save points in a graph. In this particular case it is a 2d-tree. *PointSET.java* is a set of points using Red-black BST. These two classes can search for the nearest point of a query point or find all points in a rectangle. *KdTreeVisualizer.java*, *RangeSearchVisualizer.java*, and *NearestNeighborVisualizer.java* are clients. The specifical requirement is [**HERE**](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php).

Note that [*algs4.jar*](../) need to be added into classpath.
