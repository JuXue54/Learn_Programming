# Burrows

**Burrows-Wheeler** is a data compression algorithm. The detail of this task is in [**Here**](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/burrows/specification.php). From my point of view, **Burrows-Wheeler** is very confusing and it is hard to understand the reasons of this algorithm. Besides, I refered to open codes from [**Here**](https://github.com/mingyueanyao/algorithms-princeton-coursera/blob/master/Codes%20of%20Programming%20Assignments/part2/pa5-burrows/BurrowsWheeler.java).

**Note** that [*algs4.jar*](../) need to be added into the classpath.
