# Percolation

Percolation is a task from the course called *Algorithms* provided by Princeton University. Input two parameter, n and T, when run *PercolationStats.java*. The program will build a n*n grid and then run it T times. We can understand how porous it is when the material is percolating. The Percolation task requirement is [**Here**](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php).

Note that algs4.jar have to be added in the classpath if you want to run these codes and it can be seen in [Algorithms_Princeton](../).
